She has the drive, patience to really learn new skills and make sure to finish tasks on time. Maico was able to deploy analytics solutions to the projects that she was supporting and drive business outcomes. Maico is also a team player, she was able to help and lead team engagements. She was one of the key analytics support that we have in the team. Continue doing your best Maico! You have that drive and strong passion! ”</p>

								<p>“ I met Maico through LinkedIn when she reached out to me about her passion for shifting into a career in Data Science. Based on her career plans and the efforts she's made to hone her data skills by enrolling herself in courses, I knew she had the potential. And so, I offered to recommend her to join our team in Accenture. I never regretted my decision to endorse her because I've only been hearing about excellent feedback on the quality of her work. I've seen Maico's Data Science portfolio and I can see her trying to diversify her skills by creating analytics projects in R and Python. Not only is she building her programming skills, she's also learning Data Visualization by using tools such as Tableau and Power BI. Her passion to learn more about data is complimented by her hard work and dedication. Her background in Economics is also an asset since she has an innate strategic mindset and she can use her business savvy in using data as a means to answer business problems. Aside from her technical proficiency, what I like best about Maico is her attitude to go the extra mile, her humility, and her pleasant work ethic which makes her an asset to any team.  ”</p>

One of her biggest contribution apart from developing projects is being our DTF pilot trainer for Wave 2 Power BI trainings. Thank you Maico for your contributions and i truly believe that you'll do more great things in your current and future work. keep up the good work! ”</p>
