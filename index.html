								<p>“ Maico was part of the Analytics team for more than 1 year and it was really a pleasure working with her. She has the drive, patience to really learn new skills and make sure to finish tasks on time. Maico was able to deploy analytics solutions to the projects that she was supporting and drive business outcomes. Maico is also a team player, she was able to help and lead team engagements. She was one of the key analytics support that we have in the team. Continue doing your best Maico! You have that drive and strong passion! ”</p>

								<p>“ I met Maico through LinkedIn when she reached out to me about her passion for shifting into a career in Data Science. Based on her career plans and the efforts she's made to hone her data skills by enrolling herself in courses, I knew she had the potential. And so, I offered to recommend her to join our team in Accenture. I never regretted my decision to endorse her because I've only been hearing about excellent feedback on the quality of her work. I've seen Maico's Data Science portfolio and I can see her trying to diversify her skills by creating analytics projects in R and Python. Not only is she building her programming skills, she's also learning Data Visualization by using tools such as Tableau and Power BI. Her passion to learn more about data is complimented by her hard work and dedication. Her background in Economics is also an asset since she has an innate strategic mindset and she can use her business savvy in using data as a means to answer business problems. Aside from her technical proficiency, what I like best about Maico is her attitude to go the extra mile, her humility, and her pleasant work ethic which makes her an asset to any team.  ”</p>

								<p>“ Maico was one of our active and consistent Digital Task Force member. For less than a year she was able to create 3 projects that improved and automated her own processes. One of her biggest contribution apart from developing projects is being our DTF pilot trainer for Wave 2 Power BI trainings. Thank you Maico for your contributions and i truly believe that you'll do more great things in your current and future work. keep up the good work! ”</p>

								<h4 class="client-name">Micheline Cabiles (Digitalization Expert, Shell)</h4>
							</div>
							<div class="item">
								<p>“ Maico was a trainee at our Analytiks data science bootcamp. It was inspiring to see her commitment, drive, and passion to learn new skills and take on challenges throughout the course. This was especially evident during the conduction of the capstone project where Maico and her team worked together to perform an analysis on blood donor segments using machine learning and data visualisation. A true team player, her contributions to the project were significant as she helped her team overcome challenges in data sourcing and to create a beautiful functional dashboard that effectively showcased the results of the project. "</br>

After the completion of the course, she has continued to actively develop her skills and know-how in the field of data science. I am confident that she will continue to excel in this field and serve as an inspiration to aspiring data scientists. ”</p>
